calibre is a great tool.
It's got a ton of great features, runs on many places, has a very active user base and is heavily used.
BUT.
It's not great for archival work.
Especially when the data sets grow very large.
So what I wanted was
 - calibre for large data sets (tens of terrabytes)
 - with efficiency improvements
 - and more storage backends
 - something like plex for ebooks as well
 - some capability to handle arbitary files and audio books

I also wanted something to do the "secure" and "protect" part of archival work.
Such as
 - manage tape backup
 - track versions
 - tracks and validate backups
 - pack files for distribution

Finally, one of the hardest asks
 - have (most) calibre plugins work

As ever, I couldn't find something which did all of this in a way I wanted, so I starting rolling my own.

This project shares a LOT of common code with calibre.
You could consider it a fork with teeth.
