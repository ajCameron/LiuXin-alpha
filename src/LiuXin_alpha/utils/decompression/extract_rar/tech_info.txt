Beause the means of extracting rar files is os dependant LiuXin has it's own systems here. It handles them as follows

1) Windows system
 - Uses Rarfile directly if avalible
 - if not avalible, attempts to fix (prompting the user to provide the file path to unrar.exe)
 - falls back on basic systems (taken from Calibre) if that fails

2) Linux systems
 - god alone knows
